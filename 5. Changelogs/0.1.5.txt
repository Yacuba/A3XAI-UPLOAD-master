[Changed] Re-standardized minimum spawn distances for all AI types. See end of changelog for more information.
[Changed] Improved classname verification script.
[Added] Added A3XAI_traderAreaLocations array in config file for admins to manually define trader areas. See end of changelog for more info on this setting.

More info on A3XAI_traderAreaLocations:

Expected format: Array of positions (2D or 3D)
Example (Correct):

	A3XAI_traderAreaLocations = [[14600,16797.2,0],[23334.6,24188.9,0],[2998.06,18175.5,0]];

Example (Incorrect):
	
	A3XAI_traderAreaLocations = [14600,16797.2,0]; //Not an array of positions
	A3XAI_traderAreaLocations = [[14600,16797.2,0],[23334.6,24188.9,0],[2998.06,18175.5,0],]; //Should be no comma after the last array

For performance reasons, limit use of this array to actual trader positions (Recommended maximum: 3-5 positions). This is because every spawned group checks whether they are within any of these areas every ~15 seconds.

For each defined position, an 900m radius "no aggro" zone is created where all AI that enter will become non-hostile and immune to damage. An 800m spawning blacklist will also be created where no AI can spawn.

Because positions are checked every ~15 seconds, there may be a small time window between the time the AI group enters the 900m zone and actually becoming non-hostile.

Note: If custom spawns are created within these zones, they will still spawn but will never become hostile or vulnerable to damage as long as they are within the "no aggro" zone.
	
Note: This array will only be read if no standard Exile trader markers are found. This is intended by design.

More info on re-standardized minimum spawn distances:

Minimum spawn distances between AI and players were all standardized and increased to prevent cases where AI spawn too close to players.

Static spawns (Standard and Custom):

Minimum distance between AI and any player (with LOS): 300m (Previously 200m).
Minimum distance between AI and any player (without LOS): 200m (Previously 125m, 30m for respawns and custom spawns).

Dynamic and Random spawns:

Minimum distance between AI and any player (with LOS): 400m (Previously 200m)
Minimum distance between AI and any player (without LOS): 300m (Previously 145m)
