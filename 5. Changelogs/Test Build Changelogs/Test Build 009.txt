Important: For test builds, always update all components of A3XAI used by your server

- Waypoints for infantry AI now avoid no-aggro zones.
- AI under "no-aggro" status are now immune from damage.
- Air reinforcement vehicles can now be recovered by players if A3XAI_releaseVehicleAllow is enabled.
- Fixed bug where AI vehicles would not be cleaned up if A3XAI_releaseVehicleAllow was enabled and player-claim timer expires.
- Added missing function to calculate alternate patrol position for vehicle AI that abandon their vehicle within a no-aggro zone.
- Increased no-aggro area radius around trader areas from 700m to 900m, spawning blacklist radius from 600m to 800m.
